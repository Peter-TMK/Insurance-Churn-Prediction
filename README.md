Insurance companies rely on monthly premiums from their clients as their principal source of income;
These premiums buy the client insurance against accidents, fires, injury or theft.

be it poor service delivery, competitive pricing, personal financial stress such, or other environmental factors.
This customer loss is known in the business as ‘churn’
